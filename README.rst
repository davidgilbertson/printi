ðŸš§ This Python package is a WIP. It is not yet uploaded as a package anywhere. Not tested
on anything but Windows and Python 3.10. Not tested in Jupyter.

Printi
======

Printi watches ``stdout`` and if it sees a number
that can be displayed in a more interesting way, it
will tell you.

For example, the last line in the code snippet below is ``printi`` telling us
that ``-2.467401...`` is actually ``-Ï€Â²/4``:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import cmath
  >>> from printi import printi
  >>> printi.watch()
  >>> cmath.log(1j) ** 2
  (-2.4674011002723395+0j)
  ðŸ’¡ -2.4674011002723395 â‰ˆ -Ï€Â²/4

API
===

``printi.watch()``
------------------

Printi will start watching. You can add this to your startup script

``printi.unwatch()``
--------------------

Printi will stop watching.

``printi()``
---------------------

``printi`` is also a replacement for ``print``. If you'd rather not use
``printi.watch()``, you can instead use ``printi`` directly. It has the same
API as the builtin ``print`` function.

``printi.update_config()``
--------------------------
Updates the configuration options for Printi. All possible keys, and their defaults are:

.. code-block:: python

  printi.update_config(
    min_denominator=3,
    max_denominator=100,
    tol=1e-9,
    symbol='ðŸ’¡',
    specials={
        math.pi: 'Ï€',
        math.tau: 'Ï„',
        math.e: 'e',
    },
  )

* ``min_denominator`` is the minimum denominator.
* ``max_denominator`` is the max. If this is set too high, you'll get false positives
* ``tol`` is the tolerance. This is passed to ``math.isclose`` as ``rel_tol``
* ``symbol``. Change this if you don't like the light bulb. Why don't you like the light bulb?
* ``specials`` is a dict of ``float``/``string`` pairs that will be added to the existing dict.
  To remove a key, pass ``None`` as the value. Example below:

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> printi.update_config(specials={1.2345678: 'Î»'})
    >>> 'How do you like 1.2345678?'
    'How do you like 1.2345678?'
    ðŸ’¡ 1.2345678 â‰ˆ Î»

Limitations
===========

Printi will only find 'representations' in the form a Â± b * c ** d where

* ``a`` is an integer
* ``b`` is a fraction (respecting min/max denominator)
* ``c`` is either one of the 'special' values, or a digit
* ``d`` is a selection of positive and negative integers and fractions

Check out the tests in ``/tests/test_printi.py`` for lots of examples.

Development
===========

* Run ``pipenv run test`` to run the tests
* Run ``py -m build`` to build
